
 Thanks for your interest in JFlowMap! 


 JFlowMap requires Java 1.6+ to be installed on your computer. Preferably, 
 Sun JRE which you can download from here: http://www.java.com/ 


 There are several ways to run the app: 
  
  
  1) Find jflowmap.jar in Explorer/Finder/Nautilus and double click on it.

     Then, open from the menu one of the view configuration files (.jfmv) 
     which you can find in the 'viewconf' subfolder of this distribution. 
  
  
  2) Run the desktop version from the terminal:
        
        java -jar jflowmap.jar
         
     To open a specific view type, e.g.:
       
        java -jar jflowmap.jar viewconf/refugees-flowstrates.jfmv 

     or to run in the fullscreen mode:
      
        java -jar jflowmap.jar -fullscreen viewconf/refugees-flowstrates.jfmv
        

  3) Open demo-applets.html in a browser
  
  

 Enjoy!
